The Simon Says Game is a classic memory-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It challenges players to repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors generated by the computer. 
The game starts with a single color flash and adds one new color each round. 
Players must remember and reproduce the sequence correctly to advance.

HTML is used to structure the four colorful buttons and score display.

CSS adds vibrant styles, animations, and a responsive layout for an engaging user experience.

JavaScript handles the game logic â€“ generating random sequences, tracking user inputs, checking correctness, and updating levels dynamically.

This project demonstrates core front-end skills including DOM manipulation, event handling, arrays, conditionals, and audio/visual feedback
